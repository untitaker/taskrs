# Taskrs

A task list app for [remoteStorage](http://remotestorage.io/).

The speciality about this one is that it stores its task in the iCalendar
format. Soon you'll be able to use
[vdirsyncer](https://github.com/untitaker/vdirsyncer) to synchronize CalDAV
tasks into your remoteStorage, synchronizing this app with CalDAV servers.
